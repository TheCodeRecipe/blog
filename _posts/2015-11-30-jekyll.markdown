I recently decided to start a blog. I had a few criteria:

1. free hosting
2. free custom domain support (to host it on
  [blog.thecoderecipe.com](http://blog.thecoderecipe.com))
3. good support for embedding code in posts
4. simple yet modern design

After experimenting with various "ordinary" blog platforms (e.g.
[Wordpress](https://www.wordpress.com), [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com) and
[Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com)), I discovered [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) and
[Jekyll](https://www.jekyllrb.com).

In short:

- GitHub Pages lets you host static websites for free
- Jekyll lets you generate a blog from static Markdown files
- GitHub Pages supports Jekyll out of the box

Here is what I had to do to set up this blog.

## Set up instructions

These instructions were last tested on 30 November 2015. Let me know if you encounter any problems.

### Install Jekyll and create the blog structure

The following assumes that you have Ruby 2.0 and RubyGems 2.0.14 installed.

{% highlight sh %}
# Install Jekyll and other gems that GitHub Pages uses.
gem install github-pages

jekyll --version
# jekyll 2.4.0 (should match https://pages.github.com/versions/)

# Ask Jekyll to create a new blog directory for us. Let's call it 'myblog'.
jekyll new myblog

# Create a Git repository
cd myblog
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial setup"

# Important: use a branch named "gh-pages". Alternatively, you can use the
# master branch if your Git repository is called 'yourusername.github.io'.
git branch -m gh-pages

# Create the 'myblog' repository on GitHub so that you can push to it.
# See https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-new-repository/.

# Set up the origin.
git remote add origin git@github.com:yourusername/myblog.git
git push origin gh-pages

{% endhighlight %}

### Test it out

You should now be able to access the blog at https://yourusername.github.io/myblog/. You'll notice
that it looks terrible: the CSS isn't loading!

That's because you need to customize `_config.yml`, and more specifically the `baseurl` field. If
you intend to leave the blog at that address, [you should fix it](https://github.com/TheCodeRecipe/blog/commit/3af90c98a8dfc1725ed7c22d8af2cc73446f194d).
However, if you are going to use a custom domain, you can leave it as isâ€”it will fix itself soon.

### Add CNAME and configure your domain

*Ignore this if you don't want to use a custom domain such as http://blog.yourdomain.com.*

In the following, we assume that you want to use http://blog.yourdomain.com to host your blog. Note
that the subdomain you use does not need to match the name of your Git repository (it doesn't have
to be called "myblog").

{% highlight sh %}

# In the myblog directory, add a CNAME directory with your intended domain.
echo "http://blog.yourdomain.com" >> CNAME
git add CNAME
git commit -m "Use a custom domain"
git push origin gh-pages

{% endhighlight %}

In your domain provider's DNS zone file, add a CNAME alias from your subdomain (e.g. "blog") to "yourusername.github.io".

Finally, try loading http://blog.yourdomain.com. You may need to wait for DNS changes to propagate
(up to an hour). If you see CSS-related errors, make sure that your `baseurl` config is empty.

### Update your config

Now that your blog is live, you can customize it as you wish. You will want to edit the following
files:

- `_config.yml` (e.g. blog title and summary)
- `about.md` (about page)
- `index.html` (index page)
- `_posts/*` (where all your blog posts live)
- `css/main.scss` (CSS style)

You can easily preview your changes by running `jekyll serve` from your directory. If you update
`_config.yml`, you may need to restart the server to see your changes reflected.

## Troubleshooting

Here are various mistakes I made along the way:

- `gem install jekyll` instead of `gem install github-pages` (wrong version)
- forgot to update `baseurl` in `_config.yml`, resulting in a failure to load the CSS

If you're curious, you can find the code for this blog on
[GitHub](https://github.com/TheCodeRecipe/blog). You may especially be interested in the first
commits.

I hope this helps!
